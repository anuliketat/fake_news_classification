# Fake News Classification
The Fake News Challenge was organized in early 2017 to encourage development of machine learning-based classification systems that perform “stance detection” -- i.e. identifying whether a particular news headline “agrees” with, “disagrees” with, “discusses,” or is unrelated to a particular news article -- in order to allow journalists and others to more easily find and investigate possible instances of “fake news.” 

I developed several models - deep learning neural nets and machine learning algorithms to tackle the stance detection problem, ranging from relatively simple Logistic Regression to elaborate recurrent models featuring attention. LSTM-based bidirectional conditional encoding model using pre-trained GloVe wordembeddings delivered the best performance: greater than 97% classification accuracy on the test data folowed by Decision Trees with 92% accuracy on test data.
